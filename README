To test your refinery engine:

1. Create a new branch for your engine. This means you can test multiple engines in the same dummy app by switching branches. Of course you will probably want to move your engine outside of path of the dummy app, stored in it's own repo.

2. Generate your engine in the normal manner and generate migrations.

3. Start Spork:

  spork
  spork cucumber

4. Run your tests:

  cucumber
  rspec path/to/your/engine

5. Alternative you can replace spork and rspec startups with running:

  guard
